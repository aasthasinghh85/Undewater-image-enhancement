Underwater image enhancement has been an active area of research due to the complex challenges posed by
underwater environments, such as light scattering, colour distortion, and low visibility. Numerous studies have
focused on both traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning approaches to address these
issues.  we have used the UIEB, Tensorflow and EUVP datasets.
